# Project brief

> **Superseded by `README.md` for this trial.** This brief describes generic multi-portal
> opportunity normalisation; the README describes California bidder and teaming
> intelligence, and carries the rubric the work is scored against. Where they conflict the
> README wins. Reasoning in `DECISIONS.md` §7, "README.md is the target spec".
> Left in place unedited otherwise, since it came with the repository.


## User problem

SLED buyers publish through fragmented portals with inconsistent fields, terminology, amendment behavior, and deadlines. A contractor needs one trustworthy view of what is open, what changed, what fits, and what action to take.

## Product hypothesis

Chromie can outperform a generic bid aggregator by making each opportunity decision-ready: normalized requirements, explicit freshness, all source evidence, amendment history, duplicate control, and a review queue when automation is uncertain.

## In scope

- Canonical opportunity schema.
- Adapters for the three included fixture formats.
- Exact and fuzzy duplicate candidates.
- Amendment-to-parent linking.
- Field completeness, source freshness, and failure metrics.
- Five concrete product recommendations.

## Out of scope

- Nationwide portal coverage.
- Browser automation against protected portals.
- Production ingestion or schema changes.
- Company-specific fit scoring.
- Proposal generation.

## Questions the final presentation must answer

1. Which portal differences create the most user harm?
2. What can be automated confidently, and what needs review?
3. Which early signals beyond published bids should Chromie prioritize?
4. What would it take to add the next 20 sources?

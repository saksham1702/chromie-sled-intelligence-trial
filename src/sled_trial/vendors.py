"""Vendor identity resolution and profiles, built from SCPRS award history.

Identity is not guessed. SCPRS assigns each supplier a stable `supplier_id`, so aliases
collapse onto that key without fuzzy matching -- verified on a live search where 200 awards
across 39 departments all carried one id. Fuzzy matching is used only to *detect conflicts*
worth human review, never to merge records.

What this data can and cannot support:

* Awards are wins. SCPRS records what the state bought, so it evidences awards and
  incumbency. It carries no losing bidders, so a profile can never report a loss rate, and
  `bids_total` is deliberately absent rather than set equal to wins.
* SCPRS awards are contracts held directly with the state, which is evidence of acting as a
  prime. Subcontracting is invisible here, so the absence of sub evidence means unknown.
* `cert_type` and `lpa_contract` are sparse (67/200 and 24/200 on a live sample). Absent
  means unobserved, never "not certified".

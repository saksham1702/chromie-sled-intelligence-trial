"""PlanetBids agency portals: the largest bidder-list corpus in California local government.

Hundreds of CA cities, counties, school and special districts run a portal here, one per
agency, keyed by a numeric `companyId`. Unlike the state portal, these publish **who
competed** rather than only who won:

* `bid-prospective-bidders` - every company that took out the documents, with contact
  details, small/disadvantaged-business classifications, and whether it attended the
  pre-bid meeting. That is declared interest, not a bid.
* `bid-responses` - the companies that actually responded, with rank, amount and whether
  the response was judged responsive. That is a bid.

Both carry `vendorId`, a stable platform identifier, so bidders resolve by id instead of
by name matching. That is the difference between this source and the agency PDF sources:
`vendors.resolve_bidder_identities` has to guess at Caltrans and SF names, and does not
have to guess here.

The portal is a single-page app whose JSON API answers 403 to a bare client, so a caller
supplies `fetch_json` backed by a real browser session. Nothing here performs a request
itself, which is what keeps the module testable offline and read-only by construction.

"""Leveraged Procurement Agreements: the statewide contracts a vendor already sits on.

`ZZ_PO.ZZ_CNT_SRC_CMP_BKP.GBL` ("LPA/Dept Contract Search") is public and needs no login.
It matters for two reasons the other Cal eProcure surfaces cannot cover.

**It joins on an identifier, not a name.** The result grid carries `VENDOR_ID1`, which is
the same supplier id SCPRS awards carry, and `CNTRCT_ID`, which is the same value SCPRS
rows carry as `lpa_contract`. Every other vendor surface here -- the supplier search
included -- forces a name match and inherits its errors. This one does not.

**It attaches to profiles, not to the ranking.** `predict` scores "presence on a statewide
contract or purchasing vehicle" from `lpa_contract` on the award rows and only when the
opportunity names a vehicle; the demonstrated one does not, which is why that term has
scored zero. This surface adds a vendor's current standing to its profile.

A contract is not an award: holding a vehicle means a department *may* buy without
re-competing, not that anyone has. The rows carry their validity window so an expired
vehicle is not read as current standing.
